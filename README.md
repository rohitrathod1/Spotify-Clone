## How It Works

1. **Albums are auto-discovered** from folders inside `/songs/`
2. Each folder must contain:
   - `info.json` → Song metadata
   - `cover.jpg` → Album art
   - `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav` → Audio files
3. Click an album → songs load → play!

---

## `info.json` Format (Per Folder)

```json
[
  {
    "file": "song_name.m4a",
    "title": "Song Title (Slowed + Reverb)",
    "artist": "Arijit Singh",
    "album": "Angry",
    "description": "High energy angry vibe"
  }
]

Tip: Use arrays for multiple songs per mood!
